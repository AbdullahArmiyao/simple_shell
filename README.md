# Simple Shell Repository

Welcome to the Simple Shell repository! This repository contains a basic implementation of a shell in C Programmng language.

## Overview

This shell provides a minimalistic command-line interface where users can interact with their operating system. It supports basic functionalities typically found in a shell environment, such as executing commands, handling processes, and managing file operations.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute various system commands like ls, cd, mkdir, etc.
- **Piping**: Allowing the output of one command to be used as the input of another.
- **Basic Scripting**: Ability to create and execute simple shell scripts.
- **Signal Handling**: Respond to signals and interrupts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z).
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate error messages and handling for common scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Mention any specific dependencies or requirements]
- [e.g., Linux/Unix-based system]

### Installation

To use the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-shell.git
    ```

2. Compile the source code (if necessary) using [specific build instructions]:

    ```bash
    [build command]
    ```

3. Run the shell:

    ```bash
    ./simple-shell
    ```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can interact with it just like any other command-line interface. Use common shell commands and explore its functionalities. Here are a few examples:

- `ls`: List files and directories.
- `cd <directory>`: Change the current directory.
- `mkdir <directory_name>`: Create a new directory.
- `echo <text>`: Display a line of text.
- `pwd`: Show the current working directory.
- `...` [Add any additional custom commands supported by your shell]
